- At the beginning, program should display Logical and Phisical sizes of source path file.
- Then, source file should be copied to destination path.
- Consider, that source file may contain holes, and holes should be copied as is.
- At the end (after copy) print the Logical and Phisical sizes of the destination path file (the copy).

Requirements:
