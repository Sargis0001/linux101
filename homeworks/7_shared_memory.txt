Shared Memory

Implement Producer-Consumer solution with processes.

Problem:
- Implement two programs: Producer and Consumer
- Both are aware of a global share resource with name "prod-cons-buffer", which is a shared memory in the system
- The resource is a memory with capacity of one page size
- First program adds the next character into the memory if not full yet in the infinite loop
- Second program removes the latest added character if not empty in the infinite loop

Hint: Use shared memory, named semaphores to sync across processes. 

Have a Makefile. Pay attention to coding style and comments.
